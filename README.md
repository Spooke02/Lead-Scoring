# Lead Scoring Model

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify potential leads and estimate their likelihood of conversion. This will enable businesses to prioritize their efforts and resources on the most promising leads, ultimately improving sales efficiency and conversion rates.

## Approach

This project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Environment Setup:** Utilized Google Colab for development and installed necessary Python libraries.
2.  **Data Preparation:**
    * Generated synthetic lead data with features like customer interactions, purchase history, and website visits.
    * Alternatively, a sample dataset could be used.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Cleaned the data (although no specific cleaning steps were explicitly mentioned in the provided example).
    * Handled missing values (no explicit handling shown, but this is a crucial step in real-world scenarios).
    * Normalized the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
4.  **Model Development:**
    * Developed and trained two different classification models:
        * **Logistic Regression:** A linear model suitable for binary classification.
        * **Neural Network:** A more complex model with multiple layers to capture non-linear relationships.
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluated the performance of both models on the test set using metrics such as:
        * Accuracy
        * Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)
        * Confusion Matrix
    * Visualized the confusion matrix for Logistic Regression using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
6.  **API and Deployment Simulation:**
    * Simulated a simple deployment scenario by:
        * Saving the trained Logistic Regression model using `joblib`.
        * Creating a `predict_lead_conversion` function that takes customer data as input, scales it, and predicts the probability of lead conversion.
        * Demonstrated the usage of this function with a sample lead.
7.  **Documentation Preparation:** This README file serves as the documentation for the project.
8.  **Presentation Preparation:** (Details for the presentation are outlined in the original prompt but not directly implemented in code).

**Note:** The actual performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy) will be displayed after running the code and evaluating the models.

## Future Improvement Suggestions

* **Visualizations:** Implement more comprehensive visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to better understand the data and model performance.
* **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation techniques to get a more robust estimate of the model's generalization performance.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the hyperparameters of the models (e.g., using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) to potentially improve their performance.
* **Address Model Biases:** Analyze the model for potential biases and implement strategies to mitigate them.
* **Interactive Demo:** Create an interactive demo using tools like Streamlit or Gradio to allow users to input lead data and get real-time predictions.
* **Explore Other Models:** Experiment with other classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, etc.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from the existing data that might be more predictive of lead conversion.
* **Data Collection:** If using synthetic data, consider using or collecting real-world lead data for more accurate model training.
